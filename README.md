CFX-88 Conflux Asset Token (CAT) Standard
==========================================

Simple Summary
-------------
A standard interface for non-fungible tokens to determine ownership of digital and real-world assets. 

Abstract
--------
A token standard that supports a variety of data customization and scaling approaches. Allows for implementation of a standard API within smart contracts. The standard should provide basic functionality for tracking and transferring tokens. 

Similar to the use of non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, which has gained noteriety for its use in gaming, the CAT is designed with the purpose of proving ownership of digital and physical assets to those who own them in their wallets. 

Possible uses of CATs include but are not limited to: 

* Gaming Assets - In-game characters, resources, land, missions, titles, etc. 
* Digital Art - Artists can create unique pieces of digital art limited by the token ID #. 
* Social Media Profiles - Allows a user to entirely control his/her social media info and data. 
* Official Record Keeper - such as diploma/grade information, medical records, and awards.  
* Physical Ownership Deed - to track and prove ownership of real assets such as houses and cars. 

Some CATs will require third party verification or authorization, to accommodate for this, a special set of approval rights will added whenever a CAT contract is deployed. While duplicate copies of CATs are possible, each one should be tracked individually in order to verify that a proper supply amount is minted.
